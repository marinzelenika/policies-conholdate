&nbsp;  
##### **1. Is there a discount for government agencies?**
{{< faqs 1 >}}Yes, qualified government agencies are eligible for a 10% discount. Read about [Discounts](/policies/discounts) for further information.  

&nbsp;  
##### **2. Is there a discount a for non-profit or academic institutions?**
{{< faqs 2 >}}Yes, academic institutions and non-profit charities are eligible for a 10% discount. Read about [Discounts](/policies/discounts) for further information.  

&nbsp;  
##### **3. Is there a discount for startups?**
{{< faqs 3 >}}Yes, we offer a discount for startups. Please read about [Discounts](/policies/discounts) for further information and requirements.  

&nbsp;  
##### **4. When I upgrade does the subscription expiry date of the license change?**
{{< faqs 4 >}}If you are upgrading within 90 days of purchase or renewal then the subscription expiry date resets so you will have a full subscription period from the date of upgrade. If you are renewing after this time then the subscription expiry date does not change.  

&nbsp;  
##### **5. Can I downgrade an order for a discount?**
{{< faqs 5 >}}We do not allow downgrades from a higher license type e.g Developer OEM to Developer Small Business or reducing the number of seats in the order. You can renew only some products of an order or reduce the number of maintenance years in the subscription however review the [Subscription FAQ](/faqs/subscription#13) for caveats about doing this.  

&nbsp;  
##### **6. Is there a discount for purchasing several products/licenses/subscription years in a single order?**  
{{< faqs 6 >}}There is a discount for purchasing multiple licenses which increases with each license purchased. To view the discount check out the [online pricing wizard](https://purchase.conholdate.com/buy). 

There is no discount for purchasing several individual products, instead we suggest customers to purchase Conholdate.Total which contains all products for a single platform for large discount.

There is no discount for purchasing a multiple year subscription.  

&nbsp;  
##### **7. I'm a returning customer, are there any discounts for me?**
{{< faqs 7 >}}There are no discounts for customers with existing orders unless you have an active subscription and can [upgrade](/policies/upgrades).

&nbsp;  
##### **8. I am currently using your competitor's product, is there any discount for me to change to Conholdate?**
{{< faqs 8 >}}Yes, check our [Competitive Upgrade](/policies/discounts/competitive-upgrade) policy for further details.
