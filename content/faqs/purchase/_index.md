##### **1. Can I evaluate Conholdate products prior to purchasing?**
{{< faqs 2 >}} Yes! All Conholdate products have a risk free, evaluation version available. We strongly encourage developers to [download](https://releases.conholdate.com/) and try our APIs prior to purchasing in order to ensure that they will fill your needs 100%.  

&nbsp;  
##### **2. Can I receive technical support when I'm evaluating a product?**
{{< faqs 3 >}} Yes! Our support teams will be glad to assist. We want to ensure there are no bad surprises after the point of purchase. We provide free support on an [online forum](https://forum.conholdate.com/) that is maintained by our highly trained development staff. Whether you have purchased or are still evaluating we will always provide timely, helpful assistance.

&nbsp;  
##### **3. How can I request a quote?**
{{< faqs 4 >}} You can generate a quote online, [learn more](/policies/generate-quote).  

&nbsp;  
##### **4. Can I request a quote or invoice in a currency other than US Dollars?**
{{< faqs 5 >}} Conholdate quotes and invoices in USD for all countries including Australia, however if requested we are also able to quote in Australian dollars (AUD). We cannot quote in EUR, GBP, or any other currency.

Australian dollar quotes and invoices are calculated using the current currency exchange rate.

&nbsp;  
##### **5. Can I receive the license early before paying?**
{{< faqs 6 >}} Our payment terms are Net 0-day which means payment must be received in full before we will issue the license keys. We cannot provide the license earlier however if it's urgent then we can provide a temporary license to use while waiting.  

&nbsp;  
##### **6. Are there any applicable taxes?**
{{< faqs 7 >}} Yes.  There may be taxes depending on where youâ€™re located.  

**Australia:**  Conholdate is a division of Aspose Pty Ltd which is an Australian company, so we must collect GST from all Australia-based customers.  

**United States:**  Some states have [sales tax or economic nexus laws](https://www.taxjar.com/sales-tax/economic-nexus).  Conholdate must charge sales tax in states where we are considered to have an economic nexus.  We charge sales tax in the following states:  

* Arizona (AZ)
* District of Columbia (DC)
* Illinois (IL)
* Iowa (IA)
* Maryland (MD)
* Massachusetts (MA)
* Minnesota (MN)
* New York (NY)
* North Carolina (NC)
* Ohio (OH)
* Pennsylvania (PA)
* Tennessee (TN)
* Texas (TX)
* Utah (UT)
* Washington (WA)
* Wisconsin (WI)
 

Certain customers may be exempt from sales tax.  You can learn more about sales tax issues on the [Taxes Policy page](/policies/taxes).

##### **7. I require your W-9 Form, can you send it?**
{{< faqs 8 >}} Conholdate can send you the W-8BEN-E form which is the form that we are required to use in place of the W-9 since Conholdate, a division of Aspose Pty Ltd, is an Australian company. [Contact sales](https://about.conholdate.com/contact/) to request a copy of this form.

&nbsp;  
##### **9. I have been advised that we should withhold some of the payment to you for tax purposes, is that acceptable?**
{{< faqs 10 >}} No, clause 4.4 of the [Conholdate EULA](https://about.conholdate.com/legal/eula/) states that the cost price of Conholdate products is the net amount we collect from any customer regardless of their location. Here, we explicitly state that any forms of tax, be it withholding or any other, has to be handled by the purchaser and Conholdate is not liable for that. Read about [Tax Issues](/policies/taxes) for other important information.
