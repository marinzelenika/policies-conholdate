##### **5. Can I receive the license early before paying?**

##### **6. Are there any applicable taxes?**
{{< faqs 7 >}} Yes.  There may be taxes depending on where youâ€™re located.

&nbsp;  
##### **9. I have been advised that we should withhold some of the payment to you for tax purposes, is that acceptable?**
{{< faqs 10 >}} No, clause 4.4 of the [Conholdate EULA](https://about.conholdate.com/legal/eula/) states that the cost price of Conholdate products is the net amount we collect from any customer regardless of their location. Here, we explicitly state that any forms of tax, be it withholding or any other, has to be handled by the purchaser and Conholdate is not liable for that. Read about [Tax Issues](/policies/taxes) for other important information.

&nbsp;  
##### **10. Can I get a discount?**

&nbsp;  
##### **11. Does Conholdate have a consultant team who can assist with on-site training, implementation and/or software customizations?**

&nbsp;  
##### **13. After an order has been placed, how and when can the license key be accessed?**
{{< faqs 14 >}} Access to the license(s) is provided to you only after the successful receipt and processing of your payment. Once payment is received, a confirmation email will be sent that includes your license and instructions on how to apply it.

&nbsp;  
##### **14. Where can I download my license?**
{{< faqs 15 >}} Once purchased you can also download your license from the website when logged into to your account. [Learn more](/policies/download-license).

&nbsp;  
##### **17. If I already installed the product before purchase, do I need to reinstall the software?**
{{< faqs 18 >}} No, the binaries are the same, it is the license key that is applied which makes the software run in "production" mode without any limitations.

&nbsp;  
##### **18. Which payment methods are accepted?**
{{< faqs 19 >}} Conholdate accepts payment by credit card or wire transfer. [Read more about our payment methods](/policies/payment-methods).

&nbsp;  
##### **19. Do you include tax in your prices listed on the website or quotes?**
{{< faqs 20 >}} As Conholdate is a division of Aspose Pty Ltd which is an Australian company, only GST is applied to customers who are purchasing from Australia. Our website does not display GST inclusive pricing, however when you request an invoice or quote it will contain the GST component.

&nbsp;  
##### **20. I'm based in Australia, why is GST added to an invoice that is in USD currency?**
{{< faqs 21 >}} Conholdate is a registered Australian business however as a company with customers worldwide we prefer to do business in US Dollars (USD). Since we are a GST registered business we must pay GST on any goods or service provided to an Australian entity and according to ruling GSTR 2001/2 by the Australian Taxation Office, the calculation of tax on a transaction in a foreign currency is perfectly acceptable. We have been operating in this way for many years with many Australian customers without any problems. Learn more about [tax issues](/policies/taxes).

&nbsp;  
##### **21. Who else uses Conholdate products?**
{{< faqs 22 >}} [Here is just a few of our customers from around the world](https://about.conholdate.com/customers/). As you can see the long lists of customers, many different types of businesses can benefit from Conholdate products.

{{< faqs 23 >}} No. Conholdate is located in Australia, and we do not have staff dedicated to ensuring HIPAA compliance. If you are using a Conholdate product in your application, and the application must be HIPAA compliant, then it is your responsibility to ensure that Conholdate's APIs are used in a compliant manner.

&nbsp;  
##### **23. Does Conholdate offer software escrow services?**
{{< faqs 24 >}} Yes, we do. [Read about our escrow services to find out more](/policies/software-escrow).
