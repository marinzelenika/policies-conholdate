##### **Can I become an authorized reseller?**
{{< faqs 2 >}} Yes, if your major business is reselling IT products to your customers.

The reselling process in simple. After the initial setup, you can sell our products completely by yourself. You do not have to contact us for quotes, invoices, or licenses: it can all be done automatically through our purchase system. Our approach saves time and helps you deliver products to your customers quickly.

**Note:** If you represent a consultancy firm that uses our components to develop solutions for your customers, you are not eligible for a reseller discount. Only companies who specialize in software retail are eligible for a reseller discount. We do have an alternative program that you can apply for, please apply to become an authorised consultant.

&nbsp;  

##### **How do I become an authorized reseller?**
{{< faqs 3 >}} If you have a customer who needs to purchase Conholdate products through you, you can become an authorized reseller:

1. Create an account on on our website.
This account is used for forums, purchase and reseller systems.
2. Log in.
3. Email [sales@conholdate.com](mailto:sales@conholdate.com) with brief information about your business and why you need to become an authorized Conholdate reseller.
4. Our staff will review your request. If it is accepted, you will list both Conholdate and GroupDocs products on your website, agree to our [terms](/policies/resellers/terms) and you will be given a discount rate.
5. You are now able to place orders for your customers.

&nbsp;  

##### **How do I get a reseller quote?**
{{< faqs 4 >}} You do not have to. As an authorized reseller, you will see your partner price for all of our products and pricing plans in the purchase system. Your discount is applied automatically.

&nbsp;  

##### **What discount do you offer for resellers?**
{{< faqs 5 >}} Resellers are provided with a 10% discount from retail price.

&nbsp;  

##### **When ordering for my customer, why do I have to enter my end user's details?**
{{< faqs 6 >}} When a payment has been accepted, the purchase system automatically creates an account for your customer and associates the license with that account. That is why you need to enter your customer's details as the shipping address and your own details as the billing address.

If your customer already has an account with us, the system will automatically associate the license with their username.

&nbsp;  

##### **Do resellers help customers with technical support?**
{{< faqs 7 >}} Unless explicitly requested by a customer, resellers may not seek technical support on behalf of that customer.

If a reseller is requested by a customer to seek technical support, that must be done via the forums, not via any sales or business channel.

&nbsp;  

##### **How do resellers pay?**
{{< faqs 8 >}} Read about the [payment methods we accept](/policies/payment-methods) to find out in detail about how to pay.

* A purchase order (PO) entitles you to receive the license early and then pay for this and any other invoices you place afterwards within 30 days by [bank transfer](/policies/bank-transfer). While you first build up a good track record we may release a temporary license to you to send to your customer before a permanent license is released on receipt of payment.
* [Pay by credit card](/policies/credit-card). Your customer receives the license as soon as the payment has been approved.

&nbsp;  

##### **What happens when an order is successfully paid?**
{{< faqs 9 >}} When a payment has been accepted, you will receive an email with details of the order and the invoice as a PDF file. You will also receive an email with the license file and how to apply it - it is your job to send this to your customer.

&nbsp;  

##### **Can I have a signed Reseller Agreement?**
{{< faqs 10 >}} No, simply by agreeing to be a Conholdate Reseller you agree to our [Reseller Terms](/policies/resellers/terms). Like our self-service [Product EULA](https://about.conholdate.com/legal/eula/), this helps keep us stay efficient and [Paper Free](https://about.conholdate.com/legal/paperless-policy/).

**Note:** Order details and license details are also available from the order section of the purchase system. You have access to the order information and price details; your customer has access to the license file, general information about the order such as order ID, and SKU. They do not have visibility of the price information.

&nbsp;  

##### **For US resellers, how is tax applied to reseller orders?**
{{< faqs 11 >}} For Reseller orders, the application of US sales tax is based on the location of the Reseller and not the location of the customer.  If a valid reseller exemption certificate has not been supplied at the time of order, then US sales tax will automatically be applied to the order.  Please [contact us](https://about.conholdate.com/contact/) if you need to submit a new or updated reseller exemption certificate.
