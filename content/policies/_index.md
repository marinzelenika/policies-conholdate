On this page you will find links to a number of our general policies and practices that answer your questions about how to evaluate, correctly license and purchase our products.

Conholdate is different from most companies when it comes to how we sell software. We build incredible software that developers can try before buying. To do this, we rely on a slightly different sales model. Here's what makes it different:

* No pushy sales team.
* Free 30-day fully functional evaluation install that include free sales and technical support.
* Our vast documentation, examples hosted on Github and technical forums filled with thousands of questions and solutions.
* One common End User License Agreement that covers all our download products, including those from our other ventures with product downloads.
* Easy online quote and purchasing. Place an order and pay by credit card to receive your license file within minutes.
