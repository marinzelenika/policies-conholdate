Due to the possibility of fraudulently placed orders we do not always release license immediately after a credit card is authorized. Instead, we review the order and if anything is in doubt, we contact the customer to provide more details, to ensure that the order is genuine.

We have sales staff in several time zones and can normally release the license in less than half an hour in most cases after receiving the order.
