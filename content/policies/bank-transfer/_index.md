To make payment by transferring funds to our bank account:

1. Follow the online checkout process until the last step and then enter the details under PO name and number you would like to add to the invoice (this part is optional and is for your reference only).
2. Click the green arrow button to place the order.
3. On the next page you will have the opportunity to download the invoice. Refer to the second page of the invoice for our bank account number and instructions for making payment via wire transfer.

_**IMPORTANT** - If you are paying by bank transfer, then please do not convert the payment for your order to AUD. Our bank is able to accept USD only. If your payment is converted to AUD, then our bank will treat it differently which may delay the release of your license file. We appreciate your help._

_Note that some of our customers have asked for an IBAN number which is a purely European concept and since Conholdate is a division of Aspose Pty Ltd which is an Australian company this is something we don't have. Instead use our SWIFT code in order to help direct your bank to make payment to us._

_Note: Conholdate **cannot accept** ACH or EFT as they are purley American payment methods and our bank account is located in Australia. Wire transfer is the only acceptable method for funds transfer._
