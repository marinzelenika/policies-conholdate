We care about our customers and are always looking for ways to offer them the best value for money. One method we use is a discount system. The online purchase system has two automatic discounts: products suites and quantity of product. We are also open to negotiating discounts for customer who are willing to share their experience of using Conholdate products.  
&nbsp;  
##### Automatic Discounts
###### Conholdate.Total
Conholdate.Total gives you all products from Aspose.Total and GroupDocs.Total in one cost-effective package. Each Total package includes the entire product line from each website.  When you buy Conholdate.Total you're licensed not just for the products we currently have for each website on that particular platform but also for any new products we bring out (with a valid [subscription](/subscriptions)).

###### Product Family Packs
Product family packs gives you access to one product (Conholdate.Total for .NET or Conholdate.Total for Java) across all the platform we support it on. They ensure that you can program with the file formats you need across a variety of development and reporting platforms.

###### Quantity of License
Buying in seats in bulk saves you money. If you buy multiple licenses then you automatically get a discount. Once you reach 6 or more developers a single Site Small Business or Site OEM license is more cost effective, so these licenses have a built in discount as well. These discounts are also available if you are purchasing through a reseller This system is very fair and treats all visitors equally so whether you're a small company or a corporate giant, the discount is based on units bought.

##### Negotiable Discounts
While our automatic discounts apply whatever sales channel you use. Our negotiable discounts are only available to customers who are buying new products directly from Conholdate. Negotiable discounts can not be used in conjunction with other special offers, and are not available through our resellers. Negotiable discounts are subject to Aspose's decision: the company asserts its right to accept or reject discount requests.

See below for the different discounts that we offer.

##### Experience Sharing
At Conholdate we take great pride in our products. If you have been testing an Conholdate product and are happy with the experience, we want to encourage you to share that experience with others. We are happy to give you a discount on our products if you agree to write about your experience with our products. If you have a well-visited blog we would love you to share your experience of using our products on it. In order to receive the discount you must provide permission for us to republish the review at our own blog under our own account.

Please [contact a member of our sales staff](https://about.aspose.com/contact/) for further information.

###### Non-profit, Educational, Government and Start-Up Discount
If you are:

* government agency
* a charity,
* a non-profit organization,
* an educational institution,
* or a newly formed start-up (less than 1 year old and less than 3 employees)

You can get an additional **10% discount** on top of any other discounts that already apply to your basket, on new purchases. Note that:

* This discount cannot be applied to maintenance renewals.
* This can only be redeemed directly by the organisations listed above and not by anyone working/developing on their behalf (i.e a consultancy developing on behalf of a educational institution is not eligible for this discount).

To benefit from this additional discount, please [contact a member of our sales staff](https://about.aspose.com/contact/) and provide all your organization details (organization name, web address, email address, proof of incorporation date and so on, as well as how you will use the products). If you qualify, we create a coupon code for you that you can enter at checkout.

###### Competitive Upgrade
We offer a 25% discount for customers of other vendors that have decided to switch to Conholdate products. Read about our [Competitive Upgrade policy](competitive-upgrade) to learn more.

###### Private Deal
If you still don't think that you can afford our products, you can apply for a private deal, normally a discount. To apply for a private deal, compile a list of what you are looking for and a summary of your current financial situation and send it to [a member of our sales staff](https://about.aspose.com/contact/) via email for further information. Please note this private deal is conditional and we may require you to participate in some promotion activities to qualify for it.

&nbsp;  
##### **No Discount After Sale**
It is very important to contact the sales staff for the additional discount prior to placing an order. Due to the cost of refunding a partial purchase amount, Conholdate is not able to provide discounts once a purchase has been made.
