##### **What is a competitive upgrade?**
We offer a 25% discount for customers of other vendors that have decided to switch to Conholdate products.

At Conholdate we are always keen to hear why you have decided to switch using to our products. Listening to your views and opinions helps us to continually refine and improve our own products. To encourage new customers to share their thoughts we offer a further 15% discount if you complete a case study detailing your reasons for switching to Conholdate. This represents a discount of 40%.

##### **Why should I change to Conholdate?**
We think you should consider changing to Conholdate if you are using a product that is:

- billed "per processor", one that costs more money every time you grow.
    - Conholdate does not bill this way so you can scale up without worry of additional component costs.
- untried, especially if you are using it in a mission critical position.
    - Conholdate product are used by many of the largest companies in the world. We provide stability.
- lacks the features you need and they never make the road map.
    - Conholdate development teams continually work to keep our products the best. Our staff works with our customers to add features as needed.
- offers poor or even mediocre support. We give excellent support quickly.
    - Conholdate gives excellent support quickly for free so you get fast and accurate answers to your questions.
- difficult to use and hard for new staff to learn.
    - Conholdate products are designed with the end user in mind. We take special care to develop products that are powerful, yet easy to understand and use.
