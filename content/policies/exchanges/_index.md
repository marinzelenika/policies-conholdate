From time-to-time we have customers who purchase the wrong product, or products for the wrong platform. These cases are treated differently than product refunds and are only accepted if there is proof that the purchase was made in error. We do not promise an exchange but consider each request as a special case and we evaluate the circumstances and merits of each individual request.

**We only consider exchanges within 15 days of the transaction, anything beyond this will have to be discussed on a special case basis with our sales team.**

We do not exchange:

* Software subscription renewals.
* Support or support renewals.

##### **Request an Exchange**
To request a exchange, please [email our sales team](https://about.conholdate.com/contact/) with your order number and the reason for your exchange request.
