**What is your IBAN number?** [IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number) is an acronym for “International Bank Account Number”. It is a standard which has been adopted by the European Committee for Banking Standards as a way to make money transfers in Europe easier. Since we are located in Australia, rather than Europe, we do not have an IBAN. In order to transfer money via wire to Conholdate you will simply need to use our standard bank information.
