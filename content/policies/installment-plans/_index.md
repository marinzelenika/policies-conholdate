##### **Installment Plans**
In addition to offering payment by Credit Card or Wire Transfer, if you're placing a new order and your order total is greater than $5000 USD, Conholdate offers the option to split the cost of your Conholdate license over several installments with three types of installment plan.

&nbsp;  
##### **Half Now, Half Later Installment Plan**
This plan splits your Conholdate license cost into two equal amounts. 

Payment of the first installment of 50% of the license cost is required immediately. The second installment for the remainder of the balance is required six months after the first payment.

After receipt of your first installment a Conholdate product license will automatically be sent to your registered email address. One week before we request payment for the second installment you will receive an automatic notification advising you of this.

##### **Pay Quarterly Installment Plan**
This plan splits your Conholdate license cost into four equal amounts. 

Payment of the first installment of 25% of the license cost is required immediately. Payments are required via wire transfer every three months until the license cost has been received in full.

You will be issued with a temporary license to cover the period your installment plan spans. Upon your final installment payment you will be sent a full Conholdate product license.
