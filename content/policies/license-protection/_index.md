##### **How can I protect my license file from being leaked or stolen?**
When you buy a product from Conholdate, you receive an email containing the license file. The license file is the difference between an evaluation version - a functioning but restricted version of the product - and a fully functioning, unrestricted version.

A Conholdate license is valuable: it is an investment. Occasionally, our customers are concerned about the safety of their license files and want to take extra steps to protect them from being leaked or stolen.


##### **Protecting Your License**
If you are concerned that a license will be leaked or stolen, we can help you protect it.

Refer to [Protecting your License File](https://purchase.conholdate.com/orders/protecting-your-license-file) for information on how to protect your .NET, Java or Android license. **To access the page, you need to be logged in and have at least one paid order**.

If you have questions about our licenses, read the [Licensing FAQ](/faqs/licensing).
