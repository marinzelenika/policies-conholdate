Conholdate knows that Microsoft MVPs, Microsoft Regional Directors, Java Champions and Oracle ACEs are the backbone of the .NET and Java development community. They give much of their own personal time and passion so that others can learn, grow and enjoy programming. They help provide resources, guidance and fellowship: without their efforts the community would not be the same. We're glad to have an opportunity to give back to those who devote so much of themselves to helping others.
