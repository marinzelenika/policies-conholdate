##### **How To Pay For Your Order**
Conholdate requires payment for all purchases up-front which means your license key(s) can only be made available after payment is received. If you have placed an order but find your organization will take time to make payment [please talk to the sales team](https://about.conholdate.com/contact/) and we can supply you with a fully functional temporary license which can be used until the payment is received.

The only exception is the [Metered license](/faqs/licensing/metered) as instead of paying "upfront" as with a standard license, you will pay for your usage at the end of the month.

&nbsp;  
##### **Payment Methods**
Orders are placed online via our website or by email and all prices are in US dollars (USD).

Conholdate accepts payment by these methods:

* [Bank transfer](/policies/bank-transfer)

* [Credit card](/policies/credit-card)

_Note: Conholdate **cannot accept** ACH or EFT as they are purely American payment methods and our bank account is located in Australia. Conholdate **does not** accept checks_

&nbsp;  
##### **Pay By Installment**
For orders over $5000 USD or other exceptional circumstances we understand that paying for the entire order by a single payment might be difficult so in these situations we can offer payment by installment on a case-by-case basis. If you require this please see a list of our [Installment Plan Options](/policies/installment-plans) and then [contact our sales team](https://about.conholdate.com/contact/) to discuss this option.

To ensure you receive your license key(s) as soon as possible we no longer offer payment by any form of check/cheque. See [our no check policy](/policies/no-checks) for further information about this change.
