##### **Refunds**
We want our customers to buy the right product so we provide comprehensive pre-sales support:

* Free evaluation versions of our software so you can test that they will work for you.
* Free fully functional temporary licenses to ensure the product works exactly as it would after a full purchase.
* Full technical support for evaluations so that we can help you solve any problems you have before you buy.
* Full access to documentation, video tutorials and forums to help you learn what you need to know quickly.
 
Still, every now and again, a customer asks for a refund. We do not promise refunds but consider each request as a special case, and we evaluate the circumstances and merits of each individual request. 

**We only consider refunds within 15 days of the transaction, anything beyond this will have to be discussed on a special case basis with our sales team.**

We may refund:

* A software license. We are reluctant to refund a purchase after the license or product has been downloaded.
* Fraudulently bought software. We take steps to ensure that our licenses are not bought fraudulently but if a stolen credit card is used to buy our software we will consider giving a refund.

We do not refund:

* Software subscription renewals.
* Support or support renewals.

##### **Fees**
If Conholdate decides to issue a refund in any situation, including a return of an accidental double or overpayment, then we will deduct a) a $150 USD processing fee, and b) any fees incurred by Conholdate on the original payment, such as: currency conversion losses and fees assessed by banks and/or payment networks.  If Conholdate decides to issue a credit and you are willing to accept the credit, then no fees will be deducted.
