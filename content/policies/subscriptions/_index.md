**Overview**  

When you buy a license you get a full year's subscription to software updates. If you do not renew your subscription then after the first 12 months, your software maintenance will expire and you will no longer be able to receive software updates. Renewing your software maintenance is done purely at your discretion and can be renewed any time in advance of your maintenance expiration to ensure uninterrupted access to the support and software updates.

Even when your subscription has expired you are still entitled to free technical support. Please note paid support is not included with a license as it's a separate add on to your subscription.

The subscription does not affect your license: once you have bought a license, it is yours forever and you can continue to run the licensed version of the product for as long as it is useful to you. It means however you cannot download and install a new version of the product released after your subscription expiry date, if you do that you will receive an error when trying to license the software. The error will look like this:  
&nbsp;  
        _The subscription included in this license allows free upgrades until 19 Oct 2018, but this version of the product was released on 28 Oct 2019. Please renew the subscription or use a previous version of the product._

&nbsp;  
**Checking your Expiry Date**  

You can check your subscription expiry date by logging into your account on the website and [viewing your subscription details](/policies/subscriptions/renew) or you can open your license in a text editor and the subscription expiry date can be found there.  

&nbsp;  
**Renewal Costs and Subscription Period**

If you renew prior to the date your subscription expires, the cost is 50% of the current purchase cost of the product. If you renew after your subscription expires the cost will be 60% of the current purchase price. The period of a subscription is 365 days (1 year).

You can purchase additional years at the same time however there are limits to the term you can purchase at one time:

* For Conholdate.Total the maximum subscription period is 2 years
* For all other products the maximum subscription period is 4 years.  
  
&nbsp;   
Once the time comes you can renew your subscription for that many years again with the appropriate renewal discount.

There is no limit to the number of times you can renew a subscription year after year.

**Renewing your Subscription**

[Renewing a subscription](/policies/subscriptions/renew) is easy and to help you remember, we will send you reminders when yours is about to expire. We highly recommend that you maintain your subscription to our products. With a subscription, you will always have access to the latest and most up-to-date version of the product. Without a subscription, you miss out on new features and hotfixes. Software and technologies change so our updates not only include new features and improvements but also adjustments for new technologies and standards.  

&nbsp;
