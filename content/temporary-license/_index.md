A temporary license is a time-restricted full license that lets you test every aspect of a product before buying it.  

**You can request a temporary license by adding products to your cart in the [purchase wizard](https://purchase.conholdate.com/buy). Alternatively, you can request a temporary license from [an existing quote](https://purchase.conholdate.com/orders).**  

**Once you have added the products you want to test to your cart, press proceed and on the next page you can apply for a temporary license.**  

The wizard and quote collects the information we need to issue a temporary license:  

* What products you are interested in.
* What platform you will use them on.
* What license you need.
